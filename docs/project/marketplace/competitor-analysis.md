# TeachRN Competitive Intelligence Report

**Prepared for:** The CRNA Club
**Research Date:** December 8, 2024

---

## Executive Summary

TeachRN is a peer-to-peer nurse mentorship marketplace founded by Jenny Finnell (also founder of CRNA School Prep Academy). Launched in August 2022, it operates as a separate platform where individual mentors (including SRNAs) offer paid services like mock interviews, essay reviews, and coaching to CRNA applicants. The platform charges a **35% commission** on all transactions and is web-based only (no mobile app).

**Key Takeaway:** TeachRN has first-mover advantage in the paid CRNA mentorship marketplace but faces significant competition from free alternatives (Diversity CRNA) and struggles with limited discoverability. The CRNA Club can win by bundling marketplace access with membership, offering better economics for mentors, and building a superior mobile-first experience.
