Why this program and why now? What is your ultimate goal with this degree and certification? Consider your answers to these questions as you prepare.\nTechnology can fail us all at times. We use Microsoft Teams for our interviews, which can take some time to become familiar with.\nApplicants should anticipate that interviewers will ask a broad range of questions that attempt to elicit the applicant’s understanding of the nurse anesthetist’s role, motivation, goals and leadership potential as well as clinical knowledge.\nClinical knowledge includes (but is not limited to):\nVentilator management\nABGs\nVasoactive pharmacology\nLab values\nHemodynamic, cardiac, respiratory and neurophysiology alterations\nWe will ask if you have questions for us at the end of your interview. We are glad to answer any questions you have; but we have a short amount of time with each candidate. Many questions can be answered in our documents and on our website.\nDon’t feel obligated to ask questions to prove that you are interested. We knew that you were interested when you came to the interview. After reading our materials, if you find that you don’t have questions, don’t worry. Consider articulating for the Selection Committee the 2-3 things you want them to remember about you.\nGraduate Interviews can be stressful but also very informative and fun. We want to make sure that you have the information you need to make the right decision for yourself and your family. Ultimately, we want to do what is right for our profession, our university, our program, our students, and you."
